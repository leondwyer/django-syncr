update to lin 87: casueing index error

okay on line 87 you will find a filter value '240'
87         'thumbnail_url': filter(lambda x: x.attrib['height'] == '240',

it's a hack to find the thumbnail - you-tube have increased there thumb size to '360'
87         'thumbnail_url': filter(lambda x: x.attrib['height'] == '360',
